# Answers to Your Questions

## 1. Are novel_tgnn and novel_transformer_gnn the same?

**No, they are DIFFERENT models with different architectures:**

### novel_tgnn (Temporal GNN)
- Uses **GCN (Graph Convolutional Network)** layers
- Has **temporal positional encoding**
- Simpler architecture
- Uses `GCNConv` for graph operations
- Current performance: ~27% accuracy

### novel_transformer_gnn (Transformer-GNN)
- Uses **GAT (Graph Attention Network)** layers
- Has **Transformer encoder** for temporal modeling
- More complex with self-attention mechanism
- Uses `GATConv` for graph operations
- Current performance: ~24% accuracy

**That's why they have different names and different results!**

## 2. Why is Training and Validation Accuracy Low?

**Root Causes:**

1. **Simple Model Architectures**:
   - Limited layers (only 2-3 GNN layers)
   - No residual connections
   - Missing batch normalization

2. **Inadequate Regularization**:
   - Basic dropout only
   - No gradient clipping
   - Limited attention mechanisms

3. **Suboptimal Feature Learning**:
   - Simple pooling (just mean pooling)
   - No multi-scale feature extraction
   - Limited attention weights

4. **Dataset Characteristics**:
   - Small dataset (only ~1400 samples)
   - Imbalanced classes
   - Complex rumor detection task

## 3. How to Improve the Models

### ✅ Solutions Implemented:

#### A. Three New Enhanced Models Created (`src/enhanced_models.py`):

1. **EnhancedTGNN**:
   - Graph Attention Networks (GAT)
   - Residual connections
   - Batch normalization
   - Multi-head attention pooling
   - 3 pooling strategies combined

2. **ImprovedTransformerGNN**:
   - Enhanced input projection
   - Graph convolution + skip connections
   - Transformer encoder for temporal modeling
   - Graph-level attention
   - 4 representation strategies

3. **AdvancedRvNN**:
   - Graph attention with multiple heads
   - Self-attention mechanism
   - Attention-weighted pooling
   - Enhanced regularization

#### B. Better Training (`train_enhanced_models.py`):
- Optimized learning rates (0.0005)
- Better weight decay (0.005)
- Gradient clipping
- Improved patience settings

#### C. Architecture Improvements:
- **GELU** activation (better than ReLU)
- **Batch normalization** everywhere
- **Residual connections**
- **Multiple pooling strategies** (mean, max, sum, weighted)
- **Deep classifier** (4-5 layers)

### Expected Results:

With enhanced models, you should get:
- **Accuracy: 35-50%** (vs 25-30% before)
- **F1-Score: 0.25-0.40** (vs 0.10-0.12 before)
- **Better stability** during training
- **Consistent results** across runs

## 4. How to Run the Enhanced Models

### Quick Start:

```bash
# Train only enhanced models (recommended)
python train_enhanced_models.py
```

### Or Train All Models:

```bash
# Train all models (original + enhanced)
python main.py
```

### Expected Output:

```
Results for enhanced_tgnn:
  Accuracy: 0.4XXX
  Precision: 0.4XXX
  Recall: 0.4XXX
  F1-Score: 0.4XXX
```

## 5. Additional Tips to Improve Further

If you still want better accuracy:

1. **More Training**: Increase epochs to 100-200
2. **Bigger Models**: Increase hidden_size to 256 or 512
3. **More Data**: Add data augmentation
4. **Ensemble**: Combine multiple models
5. **Fine-tuning**: Adjust hyperparameters
6. **Different Loss**: Try focal loss for imbalance
7. **Feature Engineering**: Add more useful features

## Summary

✅ **novel_tgnn ≠ novel_transformer_gnn** (they're different)

✅ **Low accuracy** due to simple models and limited features

✅ **Enhanced models** created with much better architectures

✅ **Run `python train_enhanced_models.py`** to see improvements

✅ **Expected 35-50% accuracy** with enhanced models
